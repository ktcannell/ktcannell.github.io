I've just completed Ruby Loops. 

Logically, looping makes a lot of sense. Once something happens a certain number of times, the requirement is met, and it breaks, or ends.

What if we could apply this to every day life, or, more specifically, our busy schedules and how we manage time? If we think of our schedules as fulfilling a certain unit of certain tasks each week, and loops are meant to summarize what we've done and remind us what else needs to be done, I think it could be a valuable tool for keeping organized.

For example, let's say I want to exercise exactly 4 hours per week, study exactly 15 hours per week, and sleep exactly 56 hours per week.

I'd need to define all 3 types of activity in my schedule, and get the data to feed in (or I could enter it as user_input) in order to track how I'm using my time. I would need an "until" or "while" loop to track if/when each condition was met (or reached that count). Perhaps each Wednesday, or other time in the middle of the week, I'd call the display in my CLI to see how many hours I'd completed for each task, and it would give me a summary and let me know what else needed to be done.

I'm sure this could be more complex, but as someone always seeking better ways to manage my time, I'm interested in applying what I'm learning to real life issues!
