Over the past couple of years, I have become more and more curious about the cycle of constant learning and self-improvement. I've tried studying for the GMAT, subscribe to the Economist Magazine (not just to look intelligent while riding the subway, I promise), listen to podcasts, take lots of strengthfinders and personality tests, regularly practice yoga and meditation, and constantly try to challenge myself. I haven't discovered my passion yet, but I think I'm headed in the right direction.

My entrance into the professional world wasn't typical. After high school, I moved 6,000 miles to attend a private undergraduate school and had a slim understanding of what I wanted to study. I chose Communications because I thought being a broadcast journalist would be cool, but spent the majority of my 1.5 years attending that university taking way too many core classes for way too much money.

Due to financial reasons, I could no longer attend the private university, and I moved the 6,000 miles back home for almost a year before ultimately deciding that I needed to be in New York. So I came back, found a customer service gig off Craigslist at a very cool start-up sweets company, and immersed myself in that job without re-enrolling in school, eventually moving into a HR role. After two years, I realized that I still needed a degree in order to progress, so I enrolled in night and weekend classes and, working harder than I ever have, earned my Bachelor's Degree in International Business after two years. 

I still wasn't satisfied with my role after over four years with the sweets company, so I applied for a very similar role at a very different company that's in the music, marketing, and entertainment business. I'm still in this role now after nearly two years and love my coworkers and the added responsbility I've taken on. However, I'm ready to make the jump into something new as I've come to know myself and my strengths throughout my professional career thus far.

I learned about this coding opportunity through a scholarship opportunity email, and was intrigued. Over the past few years, I've seen more and more "Girls who Code" and "Women in Dev" hype, and although it only recently crossed my mind that this is something I could love, I'm so excited to be a part of this community and movement now.
